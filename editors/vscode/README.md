## About this extension

This extension provides syntax highlighting and LSP support for both **Ziggy** and **Ziggy Schema** files.

**NOTE:** this extension bundles a WASM build of the language server, meaning that you don't need to have
the Ziggy CLI tool installed for this extension to work.

This extension will temporarily also offer LSP features for the frontmatter of SuperMD files, until
a dedicated SuperMD Language Server is created.
